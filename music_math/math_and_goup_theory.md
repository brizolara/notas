MATHEMATICS AND GROUP THEORY IN MUSIC
ATHANASE PAPADOPOULOS

Great synthesis of the early relation between math and music

Let us also recall that, in principle, every mathematical treatise of classical Greece contained a chapter on music.  In fact, such a treatise usually consisted of four parts: Number theory, Music, Geometry, and Astronomy, in that order, because the part on music was based on the results of number theory, and the part on astronomy was based on the results of geometry. To give the reader an idea of the important connections between number theory and music, we recall that **the theory of proportions and the theory of means were developed precisely for their use in music theory**. The division of a musical interval into two or more subintervals is defined in terms of proportions that depend on the pitches of the musical notes involved, and this division was formulated in terms of ratios of lengths of the subintervals to the length of the whole interval. *This mathematical theory of division of musical intervals was made possible by the Pythagorean discovery of the correspondence between musical intervals and fractions that we mentioned, and of the logarithmic law that governs this correspondence (concatenation of musical intervals corresponds to a multiplication at the level of the numerical values)*.[6]

Superparticular ratios = (n+1) / n
